Running Pizco House Examples
============================

Server
------

Run `house_server.py` to start serving an instance of House.
The House class is defined in `common.py`

Clients
-------

These should be run in parallel with the Server:

- `simple_client.py`: send instructions to the House object.
- `exception_handling.py`: select a new color for the house,
  (but only certain colors are allowed!).
- `observing_client.py`: while running `simple_client.py`, see
  how this client is notified.
- `gui_client.py`: See bidirectional communication (instructions
   and notifications) in action. (Requires PyQt)


All in one
----------

remote_start_server.py:  shows how to start a detached process to serve an object.
